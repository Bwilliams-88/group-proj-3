# Description

For this assignment my group was assigned with creating a collaborative MERN-stack single-page application by combining a scalable MongoDB backend, GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.jss server with a REACH front end. We also implemented JWT and bcrypt for login security and Stripe for a payment platform.
